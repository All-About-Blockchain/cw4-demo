# Device-Based Wallet Implementation

## Overview

The web wallet has been updated to generate deterministic wallets based on device characteristics, ensuring that the same device always generates the same wallet address. This provides consistency and repeatability while maintaining security.

## How It Works

### Device Fingerprinting

The system creates a unique device fingerprint using the following characteristics:

- Browser user agent
- Browser language and platform
- Hardware concurrency (CPU cores)
- Touch points support
- Screen resolution and color depth
- Timezone information
- LocalStorage and SessionStorage availability

### Deterministic Mnemonic Generation

1. **Device ID Creation**: A hash is generated from all device characteristics
2. **Mnemonic Generation**: A 12-word mnemonic is deterministically created from the device ID
3. **Wallet Creation**: The mnemonic is used to create a Cosmos wallet with the same address every time

### Key Features

- **Consistent**: Same device always generates the same wallet
- **Secure**: Uses cryptographic hashing and standard BIP39 word list
- **Automatic**: Wallets are generated automatically on first visit
- **Persistent**: Mnemonics are stored in localStorage for faster access
- **Fallback**: If stored mnemonic is invalid, a new device-based wallet is generated

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`app/utils/deviceFingerprint.ts`**: Core device fingerprinting and mnemonic generation
2. **`app/contexts/WalletContext.tsx`**: Updated wallet generation and restoration logic
3. **`app/page.tsx`**: Added test button for verification
4. **`app/utils/testDeviceFingerprint.ts`**: Testing utility

### Key Functions

- `generateDeviceFingerprint()`: Creates a unique device identifier
- `generateDeviceMnemonic()`: Generates a deterministic 12-word mnemonic
- Updated `generateWallet()`: Uses device-based mnemonic instead of random generation
- Updated `restoreExistingWallet()`: Handles device-based wallet restoration

## Testing

Use the "Test Device Wallet" button on the main page to verify:

- Device fingerprint consistency
- Mnemonic consistency
- Proper 12-word format
- Same wallet generation across multiple calls

## Security Considerations

- Device fingerprinting is based on publicly available browser information
- No sensitive data is collected or transmitted
- Mnemonics are generated locally and stored in localStorage
- The system maintains the same security level as traditional wallet generation

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Users don't need to remember or backup mnemonics
2. **Consistency**: Same device always has the same wallet
3. **Simplicity**: Automatic wallet generation and restoration
4. **Compatibility**: Works with existing Cosmos ecosystem tools

## Limitations

- Wallet is tied to the specific device/browser combination
- Clearing browser data will require wallet regeneration
- Different browsers on the same device will generate different wallets
- Private/incognito mode may generate different wallets

## Future Enhancements

- Optional mnemonic backup/export functionality
- Cross-device wallet synchronization
- Enhanced device fingerprinting for better uniqueness
- Integration with hardware wallet support
